- **Functionality**:
  - Allows partial or full return of items from a single invoice
  - Shows sold quantity, already returned quantity, and available quantity for return
  - Real-time calculation of return amounts
  - Prevents returning more items than available
  - Creates credit note/return invoice automatically

### 2. Multi-Invoice Return
- **Location**: Available on Invoice Details page
- **Button**: Indigo multi-return button (Users icon) in the header action buttons
- **Functionality**:
  - Allows returning items from multiple invoices for the same customer
  - Date range filtering (defaults to last 30 days)
  - Search functionality across invoice numbers and item names
  - Bulk selection of invoices and items
  - Creates multiple credit notes/return invoices automatically

### 3. Beautiful UI Components
- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive design with proper spacing and colors
- **Interactive Elements**: Increment/decrement buttons for quantities
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded status indicators and availability
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and error handling
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all device sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Backend APIs

#### 1. `returned_qty(customer, sales_invoice, item)`
- **Purpose**: Get total returned quantity for a specific item from a specific invoice
- **Usage**: Calculates how many items have already been returned
- **SQL**: Joins Sales Invoice and Credit Details tables

#### 2. `get_customer_invoices_for_return(customer, start_date, end_date)`
- **Purpose**: Get all returnable invoices for a customer within date range
- **Features**:
  - Filters out return invoices and cancelled invoices
  - Includes item details with calculated return quantities
  - Returns available quantities for each item

#### 3. `create_partial_return(invoice_name, return_items)`
- **Purpose**: Create a partial return for selected items from an invoice
- **Features**:
  - Creates new Sales Invoice with `is_return = 1`
  - Negative quantities for returned items
  - Proper account mapping and payment handling

#### 4. `create_multi_invoice_return(return_data)`
- **Purpose**: Create multiple return invoices for items from different invoices
- **Features**:
  - Bulk processing of multiple invoices
  - Individual return invoice creation for each source invoice
  - Error handling and rollback capabilities

### Frontend Components

#### 1. `SingleInvoiceReturn.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Item-by-item return quantity selection
  - Real-time return amount calculation
  - "Return All Available" and "Clear All" quick actions
  - Proper validation and error handling
  - Beautiful table layout with hover effects

#### 2. `MultiInvoiceReturn.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Invoice filtering by date range
  - Search functionality
  - Checkbox selection for invoices
  - Bulk item selection per invoice
  - Comprehensive summary of return amounts

#### 3. `returnService.ts`
- **Features**:
  - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - API communication functions
  - Error handling and response parsing
  - Proper data transformation

## User Workflow

### Single Invoice Return
1. Navigate to Invoice Details page
2. Click the orange "Return Items" button (RotateCcw icon)
3. Select items and quantities to return
4. Use increment/decrement buttons or type quantities directly
5. Click "Create Return" to process
6. Navigate to the created return invoice

### Multi-Invoice Return
1. Navigate to Invoice Details page
2. Click the indigo "Multi-Invoice Return" button (Users icon)
3. Adjust date range if needed and click "Filter"
4. Search for specific invoices or items
5. Select invoices to include in return
6. Adjust return quantities for each item
7. Click "Create Returns" to process all
8. View success message with count of created returns

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme
- **Single Return**: Orange theme (`bg-orange-50`, `text-orange-600`)
- **Multi Return**: Purple theme (`bg-purple-50`, `text-purple-600`)
- **Success States**: Green indicators
- **Warning/Disabled**: Gray indicators
- **Available Quantities**: Green text
- **Returned Quantities**: Red text

### Icons
- **Single Return**: `RotateCcw` (rotate counter-clockwise)
- **Multi Return**: `Users` (multiple people icon)
- **Items**: `Package` icon for products
- **Actions**: `Plus`, `Minus` for quantity adjustment
- **Status**: `CheckCircle`, `AlertTriangle` for feedback

### Layout
- **Modal-based**: Full-screen modals for complex workflows
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Tabular**: Clear table layouts for item display
- **Sticky Headers**: Important information always visible
- **Action Buttons**: Prominent placement for primary actions

## Database Schema

### Required Tables
- `tabSales Invoice`: Original invoices
- `tabSales Invoice Item`: Invoice line items
- `tabCredit Details`: Return/credit tracking
- Payment tables for refund processing

### Key Fields
- `is_return`: Flag to identify return invoices
- `return_against`: Link to original invoice
- `qtr`: Quantity returned in Credit Details
- `prevdoc_detail_docname`: Link to original line item

## Error Handling

### Validation Rules
- Cannot return more than available quantity
- Cannot return from already returned invoices
- Cannot return from cancelled invoices
- Must have at least one item selected for return

### Error Messages
- Clear, user-friendly error messages
- Toast notifications for success/failure
- Loading states during processing
- Proper error boundaries

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Lazy loading of return data
- Efficient SQL queries with proper joins
- Minimal API calls with batch processing
- Proper caching of customer invoice data

### Scalability
- Pagination support for large invoice lists
- Search and filtering to reduce data load
- Background processing for bulk operations
- Proper indexing on database queries

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Reason Codes**: Add return reason tracking
2. **Partial Refunds**: Support for partial refund amounts
3. **Return Approval**: Workflow for manager approval
4. **Inventory Impact**: Real-time stock adjustment
5. **Analytics**: Return analytics and reporting
6. **Barcode Scanning**: Scan items for quick return selection
7. **Print Returns**: Print return receipts
8. **Email Notifications**: Automatic customer notifications

### Technical Debt
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Implement proper TypeScript strict mode
- Add API rate limiting
- Implement audit logging
- Add data validation middleware
